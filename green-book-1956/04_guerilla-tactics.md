Chapter 04 - Tactics of guerillas.

The guerrilla is always on the offensive. To be successful he needs surprise, mobility, exact knowledge of the enemy, determination, fire action and shock action. And these, as in warfare generally, will be determined by his armament, his training, his morale, his planning, and co-ordination between higher command and the initiative of the guerrilla detachment.
He destroys enemy communications, raids enemy bases, ambushes the enemy when the latter tries to find him. But his tactics must always be in process of change because in time the enemy will have an answer for the old ones.
In guerrilla warfare the attacks must be fluid and carried out by detachments or columns, sections and even battle teams. The local commander will have the initiative in his hands.
The battle teams may move by bounds to the objective and if attacked will be capable of dissolving immediately-only to come together again later. To reach the objective the battle teams may have to infiltrate hostile strong points. This would be done under cover of darkness. The infiltration would take place through lanes previously reconnoitred.

INITIATIVE

Since the guerrilla's main task is to drain the enemy it follows that he hits the enemy in his most vulnerable area and fights for the initiative-never ground.
The guerrilla will not fight the enemy in a long battle where reserves would overwhelm him: he strikes only when he can win. And he avoids superior forces. When the enemy advances, he withdraws. When the enemy rests, he hits him. He attacks when the enemy is exhausted. And when the enemy counterattacks, the guerrilla flees.

THE GUERRILLA NEVER AFFORDS A TARGET.

The guerrilla relies on surprise above all the principles of war. He makes as little contact as possible with the enemy and uses "the smallest force in the quickest time at the farthest place" (Lawrence).
His attacks are planned and rehearsed. He strikes when the enemy is moving, resting or is lightly guarded. By using flank attacks on the line of march a much weaker force can achieve success.

THE DECISION

The guerrilla must be the master of lightning blows to achieve fast decisions. When conditions are unfavourable he disperses and shifts base immediately. He will do that when:

(1) He hasn't the forces to hold off the enemy.

(2) He is encircled and has to break out.

(3) The terrain is unfavourable.

(4) His supplies are insufficient.

Guerrilla units will only concentrate their force when the enemy is advancing and can be damaged severely. Otherwise they remain intact in small detachments. This reduces errors and makes action easier.
Also the small detachment working independently can make better use of ground and is able to break-out of an enemy cordon more easily.
The guerrilla must pick his targets wisely. His choice must lie with the ones that play up his natural advantages and which aid his general strategy.

DECEPTION

The guerrilla must muster the tactics of deceiving the enemy. He moves secretly and quickly. He travels light, is highly mobile, knows the terrain intimately and uses it .to its best advantage. He uses ground, darkness and fog to aid his attacks. He may move by night and sleep by day.
He sticks to back routes, avoids main roads and towns, seldom uses motor transport, gets to his objective by forced marches, changes direction constantly. Closely guarded territory he crosses by battle teams (two men).
His movements will be by bounds and well guarded to front, rear and flanks. The detachment will then reassemble at a predetermined point near area of attack. The guerrilla must be a master of the manoeuvre.
In deceiving the enemy as to his methods and intentions the guerrilla will use many ruses. He can always cover his tracks by leaving fast-moving snipers and smaller formations scattered over wide areas while the main forces pull out.

CONDITIONS

But a guerrilla movement can only operate if two conditions exist. They are:

(1) That there are guerrilla formations everywhere (centres of resistance) and that they are everywhere in action. Thus when the enemy concentrates on one point another blazes up. Without this he could snuff out the guerrillas in no time.

(2) That the guerrilla detachments are SELF-CONTAINED in everything needed for their operations including arms, supplies, intelligence and propaganda among the people.

Co-operation of the people is also vital to the guerrillas. Because it has to be stressed that support for the aims of the guerrillas must come from the population. Cut loose from the people, a guerrilla formation can neither develop nor survive.
And every guerrilla formation is an educator of the people, it exposes the lies of the enemy, shows the reasons for his occupation.

LARGE-SCALE

Guerrilla operations generally begin on a small level and constantly grow. By the time centres of resistance have been built and tied together large guerrilla formations may carry out combined operations.
Here the use of radio communication is invaluable. Certain formations, with a high degree of mobility, will be used to intervene at decisive points. In such cases the guerrilla formations will have beforehand the general plan of action. They will be able to act with a high degree of independence, depending on the situation, as a result.
But the guerrilla even at this point must be careful about moving on to positional warfare. He has to remember that his main task is to keep the enemy off balance. He will win if he does this.
