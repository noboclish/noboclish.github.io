Chapter 10 - Guerilla defence

Properly speaking a guerrilla never goes into a defence situation if he can avoid it. There are occasions, however, when the guerrilla will be unable to avoid a defensive battle.
Here is how he deals with such eventualities:

(1) Encirclement—The enemy attempts to destroy escape routes and then eliminate piecemeal the guerrilla columns.

(a) By reconnaissance the guerrilla probes the enemy circle. He discovers the enemy's strong defensive lines then his weak points. Having discovered the weak spot-either in men or terrain—he stages a mass break-out.

(b) The enemy attempts to hide his movements from guerrilla observation. He proceeds from the assembly area so as to reach cordon areas at a definite time. His critical period is the approach from the assembly area into the cordon area. The guerrilla attempts a break-through at this time.

(c) Break up into smaller formations and either infiltrate the enemy lines (there are always unguarded spots between defense positions) or get out by use of still smaller formations. Assemble later.

(2) Closing cordon—All enemy encircling forces advance at the same time towards the centre. Terrain here helps the guerrilla for the enemy can only use this technique in small areas. The encircling lines cannot advance equally fast and big gaps occur. The guerrilla breaks out at these points.

(3) Driving against wall of fire—This consists of a stationary defence line with other forces driving the guerrillas back against it. The guerrilla probes the defence line and the terrain. If the area is not easily defensible he stages a break-through. If the line is too solid he escapes via the attackers who will inevitably be strung out and disorganised.

(4) Driving in strong wedges—The ring is held solid and strong wedges probe forward cutting the guerrillas into smaller bands and depriving them of freedom of action. They cannot find the weak links in the enemy.
After a time this situation leads to enemy confusion no matter how well he is organised. The guerrilla utilises the confusion and by the judicious use of scouts and snipers adds to it by striking various of the wedge forces. The guerrilla commander holds his main force for a break- out. By use of mobility and avoiding the wedges the guerrilla finds the enemy's weak spots.

(5) Shock units—The enemy encircles the area and uses a strong shock force to destroy the guerrillas.
The guerrilla avoids the shock-force and breaks through.

(6) Surprise attack and hunt by special groups—The answer of the guerrilla is always to guard against surprise, avoid hunting packs and manoeuvre rapidly.

ALL-ROUND DEFENCE

When taking up position however temporary even the smallest unit prepares for all-round defence.
In the case of a strong semi-permanent base preparation gets under way from the start for a sure-fire defence method.
The column takes up a triangular defence so that each section can support the other.
Within the section the two-man teams and the section leader are similarly deployed. Pickets and sentries are posted to cover all approaches. Grenade throwers and light
infantry weapons cover ground which cannot be supported by the sections. Mines and antitank traps dominate all roads and paths. Mobile forces if possible should be prepared for enemy strikes.
If there is an encirclement of many columns, higher command organises the break-out. Diversionary attacks on the enemy's bases are organised from outside the ring. The enemy will be surprised in turn by flanking attacks designed to roll up his circle. Mass break-outs then occur.
If none of this is possible the columns break out on their own. If this is not possible the columns break up into sections and perhaps the sections into two-man teams and then get out.
The rule is: Never give battle on the enemy's terms. Divert him by quick attacks in other areas. Hit him at his weakest point and drive a wedge through him.
