Chapter 01 - Our tradition.

No nation has a greater tradition of guerrilla warfare than Ireland. Our history is full of examples of its successful use. We have produced some fine guerrilla leaders whose true qualities have never been fully assessed.
Their strength lay in the support they received from the Irish people. In the final analysis it was the people who bore the enemy's reprisals. Whoever betrayed the cause, or gave up the fight, or suffered loss of spirit, it was seldom the people.

KERNE OF OLD

The kerne of old were lightly armed foot soldiers. Their tactics were of the skirmishing kind. They harassed the Normans. In open or positional warfare they had no hope of breaching the defences of the strongly-armed, iron-clad Normans.
Art Og MacMorrough Kavanagh was a typical guerrilla leader of his period. Richard II of England came twice with large armies to subdue him (1394 and 1399) and never succeeded. Another was Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne and yet a third Leinster leader was Rory O'More. The O'Byrne's great victory at Glenmalure followed the strict application of guerrilla tactics.
Ulster produced its quota of which Shane (the Proud) O'Neill was only one. The English leader Sydney paid him a fine tribute when he said: "He armeth and weaponeth all the peasants of his country, the first that ever did so of an Irishman."
But it was left to the finest military leader Irish history has produced, Hugh (the Great) O'Neill, to understand fully the potentialities of guerrilla warfare. He proved it too for 9 years.

YELLOW FORD

O'Neill forsake his guerrilla tactics only once: at Kinsale. He did so under pressure from the Spaniards who had landed at the wrong place and time and who were insistent that he attack the encircling English army of Mountjoy. This was the first and last battle in which he adopted open positional warfare. The result we all know.
How he defeated Essex, who landed here with huge armies in an attempt to subdue him, and how these armies were dissipated in vain attempts to reach him, is worthy of study by the serious student of guerrilla tactics. He knew when to strike and when to withdraw and he never fought a battle except on his own terms. The battle of the Yellow Ford is the greatest example of this.
At the Yellow Ford he lured Marshal Bagenal with 5,000 men out of Armagh. He had full intelligence as to Bagenal's strength and battle order. He hit him with snipers all the way to the Blackwater and at a spot called the Yellow Ford—in a prepared position—he gave battle, split Bagenal's superior forces, and destroyed them division by division. Bagenal was killed, his army's retreat became a rout, three-fourths of the English forces were annihilated. It was, in effect, a large scale ambush executed in the classical Cannae manner: by drawing the enemy into the centre and closing him in a pincer.

OWEN ROE

Another O'Neill, Owen Roe (a regular officer of the Spanish army), was also a master guerrilla tactician. His defeat of General Munroe (June 1646) at Benburb is an example of how a small, well trained guerrilla force can destroy a far superior army.
First, Owen Roe's cavalry cut off Munroe's reinforcements. Then his cavalry returned and attacked the enemy's big guns. Then they swept back the unguarded foot soldiers. The victory was complete: 5,000 poorly-armed men against a standing army of 6,000. A memorable victory in any country's story.

1798's GUERRILLAS

Michael Dwyer is a much neglected figure in Irish history. It is too easily forgotten that he held out in the Wicklow mountains for seven years against England's forces. His guerrilla force grew from 10 men who came with him after the disastrous Battle of Tara to more than 150. He used every tactic in the guerrilla handbook and was never really defeated.
But Michael Dwyer's example is important in other ways. He could not hope to win as long as only his small force was in action. Had other groups risen similarly throughout the country, the outcome would have been far different. But the true application of guerrilla tactics to a revolutionary situation was not properly understood at the time.

FINTAN LALOR

James Fintan Lalor (1848 leader) never got the opportunity to carry his guerrilla theories into the battlefield. But that he understood these tactics is evident from his writings. Take this quotation:
"The force of England is entrenched and fortified. You must draw it out of position; break up its mass; break its trained line of march and manoeuvre, its equal step and serried array ... nullify its tactic and strategy, as well as its discipline; decompose the science and system of war, and resolve them into their first elements."

FENIANS

Lalor, after his 1849 abortive rebellion, fathered the Fenian movement through such figures as John O'Mahony and James Stephens. But one Fenian figure above all practised guerrilla warfare extensively and again like Michael Dwyer failed because his tactics were little understood and he was left isolated.
This man was Captain Mackey Lomasey, affectionately known in the Cork area where he operated as "The Little Captain," an Irish-American who harried English garrisons for arms for a long time before being taken. Lomasey learned his guerrilla tactics while an officer with the Union forces in the American Civil War.

BLACK AND TANS

By guerrilla warfare after 1916, with the united resistance of the Irish people to British rule almost a fact, and spearheaded by the I.R.A., it became quite obvious that England could no longer govern Ireland. By the time of the Treaty it has been calculated England could not have reconquered Ireland with less than 100,000 troops aided by all the accoutrements of modern warfare.
It is now almost an accepted historical fact that had Lloyd George's bluff been called during the Treaty negotiations-and that he was bluffing is no longer in doubt-the outcome would have been a free Ireland. The bluff was, of course, that he would declare "immediate and terrible war."
But guerrilla operations which made this great success possible had to have a united people behind them. British Government in Ireland no longer existed in fact. British terror in Ireland could not hope to revive it. And terror had come as a last resort but one. The final one was to split the people.
The hammer blows of the guerrillas destroyed the British administration. The guerrillas acted in small numbers in the right localities and compelled the British to disperse to find them. Then as they searched they hit them at will by means of the ambush. Communications were systematically destroyed and even the British army's transport system in the country was disorganised.
The enemy's intelligence service was completely dislocated. The R.I.C.-the eyes and ears of British rule-was demoralised. British justice courts could not operate-for the people ignored them.
The British gradually were forced to evacuate the smaller more isolated garrisons. They concentrated in the larger towns. The areas evacuated came under sole control of The Republic. The next step was to isolate the larger centres and keep cutting communications and constantly hitting the enemy. In time these would have been evacuated too. Thus ended the last great phase of guerrilla operations against British rule in Ireland.
