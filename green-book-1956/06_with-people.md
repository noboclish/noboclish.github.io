Chapter 06 - With the people

Successful guerrilla operations involve the people. It is the quality of their resistance to the enemy and support for the guerrillas which in the end will be the decisive factor. The guer- rillas are the spearhead of the people's resistance.
In fact, a guerrilla force will be unable to operate in an area where the people are hostile to its aims. And it must be remembered always that it is the people who will bear the brunt of the enemy's retaliatory measures.
Accordingly there should be constant contact and co-ordination between the guerrillas and the local population. This is aided by:

(1) Recruiting volunteers for columns from population of territory in which column is operating.

(2) Use of civil political committees among the people whose function it would be to agitate against the oppressor, get new members for guerrillas, organise supplies for columns, provide transportation for guerrillas, lead the people in a campaign of active and passive resistance to enemy occupation.

(3) Have guerrilla agents working among civilian population collecting information for army.

(4) Use of part-time guerrillas who would continue in civilian occupations yet be available for active service when called on. Thus local companies would be built up and used as reserves when the occasion warranted.

(5) Build up liaison between guerrillas and people until such time as it was perfect. When the people suffer under enemy oppression for aiding the guerrillas the latter would help and protect the people.

INFORMATION

To build up the resistance of the people to the required pitch needs more than guerrilla activity. The aims of the movement must be popularised, the objectives clearly stated, and the world must be informed of what is happeningâ€”and why.
This type of information is actually good education too. Part of the education process is countering the enemy's propaganda. The basic idea is that the guerrilla education campaign must be continuous, must beat the enemy at his propaganda game and must expose his lies to the people and indeed to the whole world.
This end of the guerrilla operations is no less important than the destruction of enemy resources and bases.
Information must be factual to build up confidence among the people in the national movement. What it must do is this:

(1) Give the people tenacity to stand up to the enemy by showing them the struggle is worthwhile and necessary.
They must be made aware that the national struggle will be victorious in the end-but that the end depends on them.

(2) Get world public opinion behind the just fight of the people.

(3) Undermine the enemy's morale and his propaganda by exposing his methods and by constant emphasis on the unjust-ness of his cause.

(4) Be the spiritual mainspring of those actively engaged in the national movement so that they understand the need to destroy the enemy and his power forever.

METHODS

The main channels of information available to the guerrillas are newspapers, leaflets, radio, word of mouth. Other methods may be worked out and new ones invented. For example: Painting of slogans, proclamations and manifestoes and so on.
All the means of winning the confidence of the people must be utilised. The ideas of the movement must be so popularised that no one is in doubt-least of all the enemy-that it will win eventually.
This information service must function continuously to get maximum results. Among the things it must do are:

(1) Show weakness of enemy position and propaganda used to bolster that position.

(2) Show what is wrong with political and social order.

(3) Suggest remedies and how they can be brought about.

(4) Be in touch all the times with thinking of the people. 

ACCURACY

The guerrillas' information service will be judged on its accuracy. It must tell the people exactly what is required of them. It must show that the guerrilla movement is all-knowing, all- powerful, a part of the people's life-the people are a part of it.
Its broadcasting must be so interesting that friend and foe alike tune in. This rule applies to all information media.
The information service of the guerrilla command should work in close liaison with intelligence so that information is up to the minute and accurate and yet does not give away information to the enemy.
It would also independently collect and evaluate and distribute its own information. The world has to be informed of what is happening for it will be basic enemy policy to shut off all contact between the movement and the rest of the world.
The world must know and understand what is being done, what the enemy is trying to destroy and why, and the way these things can be ended and peace restored and freedom won.
The use of regular bulletins for foreign newspapers and news-agencies becomes a necessity. The bulletin should be of the documentary type: no room for emotional pleas or the like. Just the facts.
