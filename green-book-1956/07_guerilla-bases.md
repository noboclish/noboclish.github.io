Chapter 07 - Guerilla bases

The guerrilla column will have a base to serve as a rallying point, as an assembly area after an attack or a withdrawal, for use as a training camp, a place for the wounded, and for general regrouping.
From these bases the enemy will be raided, his communications cut, his strongpoints subjected to heavy and consistent attacks. Outlying enemy areas, adjacent to the bases, must be destroyed beforehand.
The bases can be large or small, elaborate or quite simple. If the guerrilla movement is sufficiently strong and well developed the bases will reflect this and may indeed be quite large. Otherwise they should be scattered, inconspicuous and wd hidden.
At best the bases can only be semi-permanent. They will be
changed as often as the situation warrants. Large ones suffer the disadvantage of attracting enemy attention: they offer him a target. And, of course, the whole aim of his strategy is to be able to do just that.
Guerrilla bases must have a good line of withdrawal in case of attack. Indeed they should have several routes of escape. If possible there should be only one entrance and the base should be located in an inaccessible areaâ€”mountains, marshes, uninhabited places.
They should be changed frequently.

DEFENCE

The defence of a guerrilla base must be so organised that:

(1) A few snipers (acting as look-outs) can cover approaches for long distances. There should be a clear-cut system of alarms and a well-worked drill for evacuation of volunteers and supplies.

(2) There should be an emergency exit so that the attackers can be hit from the rear.

(3) The lay-out of the column dug-outs should be such that all sections of the column are in a position to manoeuvre or completely dissolve as the occasion warrants. Best is the triangular form. Each dug-out would give supporting fire to the other.

(4) Dug-outs should be camouflaged for defence from air and ground attack, have an all-round traverse and be well camouflaged.

(5) There should be caches for arms and supplies which would be insulated against water and drainage.

(6) Approaches may be mined and bases near main roads should have exits facing away from the road.

(7) After the capture of guerrillas belonging to the column the bases must immediately be changed. A force might, however, be left behind to surprise the enemy if he attacks.

POINTS TO NOTE

In guarding bases sentries should work in pairs and have frequent relief. They should have definite instructions on the line to take in case of attack or if a civilian blunders on the base.
In the case of innocent blundering on the hide-out, the sentries should be able to grab the individual and leave subsequent matters to the commander. In the case of an attack, the drill for the occasion should go into operation without delay. The base must never be surprised.
Camouflage is vital to the digging of any dug-out. The line should fade into the background. If caves are used the opening might be covered by dirtied sacking curtained off by leaves and twigs. But foliage must be changed often-(in case of withering) and tracks must be carefully covered for they show from the air.
Finally, bases are for the storing of arms and for training while resting. They are not places for lying low and the guerrilla must avoid the temptation to use them as such.
