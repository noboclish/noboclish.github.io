Chapter 08 - Guerilla attack

The regular soldier is no match for the trained guerrilla in attack. Because the guerrilla holds the initiative, strikes when he is ready, uses shock action and surprise to attain his ends, then breaks contact and withdraws.
Guerrilla attacks are fluid. There is a large measure of decentralisation, and manoeuvres are carried out by battle teams who know their job and do it.
The battle teams move by bounds to the objective and may
have to infiltrate hostile strong points. They cloak themselves in darkness. They infiltrate through previously reconnoitred lanes. When they hit the strongpoint they use their first waves to cut enemy communications, support and supplies. Then the final subjection is accomplished by the use of close fire-power-small arms, LMGs, mortars, high explosives, thermit and flame throwers. Or whatever weapons the guerrilla commander has at his disposal.
The guerrilla turns night into day. He knows that at night accurate aimed fire is impossible. That control is very difficult even for seasoned troops. That a force can hit and then dissolve. He exploits these advantages and becomes adept at night operations.

SIMPLICITY

Certain rules govern all attack situations. Thorough reconnaissance is necessary before the assault. The enemy's strength and defences are ascertained. The guerrillas move by night and rest by day. They get as near as possible without being seen.
The guerrilla takes it for granted that his movements may come to the enemy's attention so he guards against surprise. He avoids the local population. His movements must give no indi- cation of his eventual target.
He will, of course, be self-contained. His equipment will be as light as possible. He will be well camouflaged, wear light clothes, tape grenades and other equipment that might rattle. He darkens his hands and faceâ€”burnt cork is good for this.
With accurate information on the enemy's defences the guerrilla commander may stage a rehearsal. Every man will know his job. Every man is fully briefed on his role and the plan itself.
The plan must be simple. Complicated manoeuvres always break down. The attack must be timed with precision and it should move at top speed. There must be total surprise, a thorough carrying out of the job to be done, and then a planned withdrawal.

WITHDRAWAL

The guerrilla must live to fight another day and for that reason the withdrawal is as important as the attack itself. There should be no slip-up. Assembly areas must be clearly understood and an alternative rendezvous should be named in case of interference with the original plan.

There must also be a plan for evacuation of the wounded.

And the withdrawal routes must be well chosen so that there is no confusion.

After the attack a full conference should be held by the guerrillas. Every aspect of the job will be examined. Mistakes will be pointed out. Weaknesses and strength of the enemy will be gauged.

More than any other soldier the fighting morale of the guerrilla must be on a very high plane. Every volunteer is imbued with aggressive confidence in his fighting skill and the impor- tance of that skill to his comrades and to his people. This pride will lead him to do the apparently impossible-and the "impossible" will seem easy as a consequence. His enthusiasm will be infectious and generate such power that no force on earth can stop it.
For the fight he is engaged in is worthy of nothing less.
