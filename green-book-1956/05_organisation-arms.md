Chapter 05 - Organisation and arms

The organisation of a guerrilla force in the field must in no way duplicate that of a regular army. Its objective, tasks, need and outlook are completely different. Its structure must be elastic so that it can fit in with terrain conditions and operational necessity.

Three points must be made clear at the outset:

(1) The membership of a guerrilla force operating in a particular area should in the main consist of locals. Since small blunders may lead to major setbacks the guerrillas should know the terrain like a book. For this knowledge locals are invaluable.

(2) The guerrillas are volunteers and are inspired by an ideal. Therefore their loyalty, understanding of what is at stake and discipline will be-and must be-on a much higher level than that obtaining in a regular army.

(3) Leadership will not come so much by appointment as by the trust the guerrillas place in their commander. He must be worthy of that trust if he is to succeed.

From these points follow a number of principles:

(a) Organisation will vary according to the conditions. Above all it must not be rigid.

(b) Instead of discipline of the regular army type there will be a more stern battle
discipline: agreement on the job to be done, and the need to do it, and obedience to the guerrilla code, these take the place of the unthinking army type discipline.

(c) Breaches of the guerrilla code—desertion, betrayal, breach of confidence in any way—must be severely dealt with on the spot.

(d) Guerrillas' work in decentralised or dispersed units. The independent detachment (15 to 25 men) is the key to the organisational structure. The detachment will decide its own local targets and carry out its job within an area without further orders. It can expect little help if it fails in its mission. It takes its punishment alone.
Accordingly organisational co-ordination is not important. But there may be, as the occasion demands, operational co-ordination of several guerrilla detachments.

(e) Since guerrillas are self-contained they dispense with the supply and reserve methods of regular formations—where our fighting man may be backed up by as many as 10 non-combatants.

THE COLUMN

From this it follows that organisationally the basic guerrilla unit is the independent detachment—or as we in Ireland named it, the Flying Column. Its strength will follow development and local needs. Operationally, it is under higher command but at the same time knows its own field of operations and carries out its tasks without further checking.
It may be called on by higher command to carry out certain tasks or support other columns in the field. But most of its time will be taken up with local operations.
The column should be able to live and fight on its own for a long period of time . . . without help from any quarter. And it does the following:

(1) Picks its own targets except when acting under direct orders of higher command.

(2) Co-ordinates its activities with other columns through higher command.

(3) Gets its reserves and replacements from the local population.

(4) Is responsible for its own security, intelligence, arms, equipment, supplies, and propaganda among the people.

(5) To operate outside its allotted territory it must get the sanction of higher command. Also it passes along all intelligence data collected to higher command.

SECTIONS

The flying column should be as small as is operationally possible. It should seldom exceed 30 men. When it grows stronger new columns may be created. Its size aids its fast manoeuvrability.
The basis of all tactics is fire and movement. The column will concentrate more firepower for less men and thus achieve striking superiority over enemy forces when in the attack.
It would break down in this fashion:

(1) The battle team—consisting of two men for fire and movement. The team could be a tactical entity when required: one would give fire support while the other manoeuvred.

(2) The section—consists of two battle teams and the section commander—five men. Three sections make up the basic column. The commanders and column commander are the column H.Q. and every volunteer is a fighting man.

The battle teams and sections will be trained to operate on their own.

ARMS

Almost any small arms weapon can be a guerrilla weapon. For assault: sub-machine- guns, light machine-guns, shotguns, explosives, grenades, pistols, automatic rifles, flame throwers are needed. For support, light machine-guns, rifles, 2" mortars (for high angled fire) and rocket launchers.
But it will be the fortunate column that can have all or most of these weapons. For the most part the guerrillas have to make and improvise.
For many guerrilla operations explosives can be used to make up arms deficiencies. Entrances can be made to buildings by the use of surprisingly small charges. (Always on the building's blind side.)
Breaking down enemy resistance is also easier once explosives are employed. Charges of one pound H.E. can be used to mop up the enemy. And pole charges (10 pounds or more of H.E.) from the end of a long pole fired by a time fuse are invaluable for pillboxes and higher windows and such like.
Charges can also be used in ambushes. Buried along the approach route (9 inches to a foot in depth) in a quantity of four pounds to a foot they can be fired electrically from cover. The enemy trucks, once stopped, can then be attacked from nearby, also using explosives.
Four-pound charges can also be spaced for guerrilla protection in much the same manner as anti-tank mines. As well, explosives can be strapped to ten-foot planks for use against enemy trucks and vehicles and other points.
The employment of explosives, once their tactical use is understood, can have many variations. They are only dangerous in the hands of inexperienced men—once the usual precautions have been taken. Fire is also a potent guerrilla weapon.

The guerrilla armament must -be light and carry concentrated firepower for shock engagements. Heavier weapons may be used in the fire base while lighter and closer ranged ones are employed in the final assault.
Every man in the column should be able to handle all weapons of the column, maintain them and repair them.

Task of the column: To get as near as possible unobserved to the target and then use surprise and shock tactics to win.
