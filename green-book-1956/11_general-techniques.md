Chapter 11 - General techniques

The guerrilla must always remember that his main job is the destruction and break-down of enemy communications, administration and supplies, and not the capture of specific objectives. Therefore, the more the enemy is harried the better the result. The guerrilla can always harry the enemy by even small scale methods.
Trees felled across roads can cause long delays. Railway signal boxes can be effectively sabotaged. Telegraph and telephone lines can quite easily be put out of order.
Four men can fell 200-300 trees of one foot diameter in a day. These can be set up as barriers or barricades.
A stone tied to the end of a long piece of cord can be thrown over a wire and the wire lowered to the roadway and then cut.
When using explosives it should be remembered that a pocket knife, adhesive tape and matches (if possible, phosphorous matches) are indispensible.

HOW TO DO IT

Fit fuse in detonator at opening and crimp the det. to the fuse to stop it from slipping out. Always cut the other end at an angle to effect rapid lighting. Wind waterproof sticky tape around the connection point where the fuse fits the det. to prevent moisture.
Always see that explosives are in close contact with the object to be blown up— especially if it is metal. If contact is not possible increase the amount of explosive. Make sure each parcel of explosive is touching the next.
Ensure also that they are well tamped down as the success of any explosion depends on confining the charge in a restricted space. If using ammonal it is advised that the primer, fuse and det. be laid beneath the surface of the ground for safety.
Explosives actually sever only where they are in contact with the objective, except in a minor degree where this is due to blast effect.
For metal—Use a half pound of explosive for every half inch of thickness for a width of a foot.
For stone or brick—Use a half pound of explosive for a thickness of 10 inches by a width of one foot.
For woodwork—Use a half pound of explosive for five-inch thickness by a width of a foot.
It will be seen from these that the standard ratio of the above is 1-20-10. Further note, that should the object to be exploded be of circular form, calculate as though it were a square and use approximately 4/5ths of this amount.
For these three types of objects the following explosives can be used but make certain that a primer is also used with TNT, gun-cotton, gelignite and plastic.
One useful method of calculating quantities is to divide the thickness of the object in inches by 10 in the case of wooden targets, 20 in the case of stone and 1 in the case of metal. Then obtain the square of the figure and allow twice the amount for every foot of width. This will give the minimum effective quantity of explosives in pounds that is required. Always be on the generous side.

EXAMPLES

Here are some examples:

(a) To demolish a metal structure four inches thick by three feet wide.
4 x 4 = 16.
Therefore 32 pounds of explosive are required for each foot. For three feet 96 pounds will
be needed.

(b) To demolish stonework 10 feet in diameter:
10 feet = 120 inches.
This, divided by ratio of 20 is equal to six.
6 x 6 = 36.
Therefore 72 pounds will be needed for every foot of width. As this is a circular object, allow the same width as thickness which gives a width of ten feet.
Thus explosive required for a square objective 10 ft. by 10 ft. is 72 x 10 or 720 pounds.
As this is a circular section all that is required is 4/5ths of this amount or 576 pounds.

Roadways—Sixty pounds of explosive buried six inches beneath the level will cause a crater of 12-14 feet across.
When using explosives for mining or cratering, always tamp them tight. For this purpose it is preferable to use ammonal or gelignite without the aid of a primer.

Buildings—Sixty pounds for every 100 square feet of space on ground floor level is sufficient to demolish a two-storey house. It is necessary to close all doors and windows to get the maximum effect.
The best results are obtained when the charges are placed in the middle of each room.

Bangalore torpedo—This is one of the most effective methods of clearing barbed wire entanglements, and is prepared by use of metal pipe filled with explosives. Any pipe of an inch and a half or more diameter will do.
Make certain that the length of the pipe is never less than the depth or width of the entanglement, as it is the effect of the disintegration of the metal of the pipe which bursts asunder under the wire barricade, and not the explosive, that counts. Always ensure the pipe is kept at least 18 inches above ground, to keep the maximum tearing effect.

TO MAKE

To make Bangalore: Fill pipe with explosive and tamp well down. Lay primer and det. with fuse fitted at one end. Plug both ends with wooden stoppers, one of which should have a hole to allow the fuse to enter.
Should the torpedo be more than eight feet in length always fit a fuse of F.I.D. through the middle of the explosive from end to end. This enables a perfect detonation to take place.
The torpedo is also effective against road or tank blocks, as it has a great disintegrating effect, and if arranged on small road blocks, are useful in dealing with enemy tanks.
Safety with explosives—Always allow sufficient length of fuse so as to get to safety before explosives goes up.
Clear the area of friendly personnel. Never attempt to examine enemy explosive charges. Leave it to the specialist. Never use naked lights or allow smoking near explosives. Do not use steel or iron instruments in handling, laying or tamping.

MAIN EXPLOSIVES

Gelignite is brown, used for cutting. Initiate with primer. Can be initiated with bullet. Keep in cool place.

808 looks like shaving soap. Yellow colour. Cutting or cratering. Do not inhale fumes.

TNT is yellow thready cake. Use for cutting and is liable to dry up and crumble. Store in box until needed.

Ammonal has greyish dusty appearance. For cratering or excavating. Keep away from damp.

Wet gun cotton looks like white candle wax cake. Used for cutting. Liable to dry and crumble. Store in box.

Plastic looks like putty. Used for cutting or excavating.

822 is a liquid for general purpose use. Must be initiated by det. fuse and a primer is required.

Fuses are either burning or det. type. Check rate of burning for speed. All burning fuses have a blackish powdery core.

DET. TYPES

Cordtex—white and silver core. Damaged by damp. Allow more. Burns at 6,000 yards per second. FID—yellow core with leaded cover. 5,000 yards per second. Operates under water. Make sure no bends or kinks. Throw away first foot when cutting off a portion. Primacord has yellow cord and coarse yellow cover. 6,000 yards per second. Allow extra two feet.

SABOTAGE

Put sugar or sand in petrol tanks. To immobilise enemy aircraft best place is the elevator. This is made of fragile material and can be easily damaged. If the elevator is out of action plane can't rise into the air.
When attacking enemy railway communications try to blow up a bridge since this is the most difficult to repair. Blow up a train so as to block the track. This will distort the rails and prevent enemy traffic passing for quite some time.
Unbolt railway lines at an embankment or curve. This tilts the train off the lines for a considerable time.
If there is not time for this a half hundredweight of fat, lard or grease, spread on an upward gradient will prevent the engine gripping the rails.

ANTI-AIRCRAFT

Guerrillas on the move must always be on the watch for enemy aircraft. Also when resting.
One of the best protections is a standard warning system. The columns should always be dispersed when moving in daylight in case of aircraft. Air guards should see and watch for air- craft when in camp. The drill is—scatter, hit the ground, take cover.
Slit trenches and dispersal will be sufficient protection against enemy bombing of a camp.

HELICOPTERS

Enemy increasingly uses helicopters against guerrillas. The Westland Whirlwind is for troop assembly and dispersal. The Two-Seater Saunders Roe Skeeter is for staff officers and reconnaissance.
