Chapter 09 - Enemy tactics

The enemy will use every device he can command to destroy the guerrilla movement. These will include: martial law, curfews, blocking of roads leading to towns, cities and villages and his own garrisons, round-ups, night patrols, use of hostages, reprisals, propaganda to alienate local population from the guerrillas, torture of prisoners. ..
Tactically he will attempt any or all of the following to destroy the guerrilla columns:

(1) Encirclement—He throws a cordon around the guerrilla area and then closes the ring.

(2) Surprise attack—By use of special troops and helicopters he will try sudden strikes which ensure that the guerrilla is kept moving if nothing else.

(3) Trained bands—He employs small but effective auxiliary police or army units who can move fast, know the country and the people and whose job it will be to destroy the columns, cut their communications and strangle their supply lines.

TECHNIQUES

The enemy will utilise surprise and will attack in bad weather, at night or when the roads appear impassable.
The enemy hopes to achieve this surprise by guarding his intentions and by constant change of direction. They also search constantly for guerrilla bases and comb the countryside as well as using patrols and reconnaissance units and local guides when on this job.
In following his basic anti-guerrilla techniques the enemy does the following:

(1) Encirclement—He cuts off all escape routes and then sets out systematically to destroy the guerrillas. Assembly points will be long distances from the guerrilla areas. The encircling lines will be fixed in accordance with the terrain. The aim is to close a ring around the columns and hold them.
Here the enemy's weakest point is his approach to the encircling areas from his assembly point. He will use vehicles and heavy weapons and strong reconnaissance units. When he has his completed he may use several methods to finish the job.
Some of these are:

(a) All encircling lines advance simultaneously towards the centre. This can only be done in relatively small areas. Otherwise great gaps occur in the circle.

(b) As one force digs-in the other lines close in. The idea is to drive the guerrillas against a wall of fire and kill them. The attackers keep pressing the guerrillas all the time.

(c) The wedge system-As the ring is completed other enemy forces drive strong wedges towards the guerrillas.
As the wedge splits up the guerrillas, several smaller rings are created. Each ring is then sealed off and the guerrillas caught within it are systematically destroyed.
Or if the enemy's intelligence tells him the guerrillas are operating from a special base, he will encircle the area and use shock troops to destroy the guerrillas.

(2) Surprise attack—The enemy avoids the trouble of encirclement and tries for a knock-out blow by a surprise raid.
He picks a time when the guerrillas are resting or least expect an attack. He reconnoitres beforehand to get the exact location of their base and its strength. And then he assembles secretly and as the guerrillas withdraw he moves up along the flanks.

(3) Special bands—When the guerrillas are weak the special bands go into operation. They track-down the guerrilla column, keep it on the move. They try to overtake, hold and then destroy the columns. Above all they go for the guerrilla H.Q.
For this purpose special police are used. They are constantly deployed to keep the guerrillas on the move and thus prevent harassing actions. They clear areas of guerrillas and try to wear them out. Mostly they are recruited locally and know the country well. Their forte is the surprise attack.
They watch supply areas and are specially armed for the job at hand. They are in constant radio touch with real units for immediate reinforcements.

THE ANSWER

The enemy's counter-guerrilla tactics sound formidable but they will be of little use against skilled columns who understand the motives behind them and stick to their original objective.
The guerrilla must know and understand that:

(1) No encirclement is complete enough that it can't be broken. There are always weak links and these must be found, probed and exploited. Note where units link-up.

(2) Proper intelligence can counter the special surprise blow. The guerrilla must always be on his guard.

(3) When the enemy attacks with his trained bands of hunting packs the guerrillas must fall on them and ruthlessly destroy them. Provide diversions. Hit the enemy's base. Cut him off. When one area is under enemy attack, increase activity in other areas.
The guerrilla must retain the initiative at all times. And he must stop the flow of information to the enemy. The guerrillas must be so trained that on capture despite the enemy's pressure they reveal nothing. For the enemy hopes to build up his knowledge of the guerrilla in this fashion: get his strength, its aims, its objectives, its leaders, its supplies, its bases and so on.
