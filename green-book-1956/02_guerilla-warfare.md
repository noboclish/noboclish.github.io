Chapter 02 - What is guerilla warfare?

A small nation fighting for freedom can only hope to defeat an oppressor or occupying power by means of guerrilla warfare. The enemy's superiority in manpower, resources, materials, and everything else that goes into the waging of successful war can only be overcome by the correct application of guerrilla methods.
Guerrilla warfare might be defined as the resistance of all the people to enemy power. In the struggle the guerrillas act as the spearhead of the resistance.
Up to the second world war the military textbooks ignored this phase of warfare. After that they couldn't afford to ignore it. Now the General Staffs are working out methods of dealing with guerrillas. Britain has built an independent Brigade to deal with them. In the age of the H- Bomb, strangely enough, the tactics of guerrillas are being widely copied.
For example, the former British Chief of the General Staff and Commander of the 14th Army, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, has this to say on the matter:
"Dispersed fighting, whether the dispersal is caused by the terrain, the lack of supplies or by the weapons of the enemy, will have two main requirements—skilled and determined junior leaders and self-reliant, physically-hard, well disciplined troops.
"Success in future land operations will depend on the immediate availability of such leaders and such soldiers, ready to operate in small independent formations. They will have to be prepared to do without regular lines of communications, to guide themselves and to subsist largely on what the country offers.
"Unseen, unheard and unsuspected, they will converge on the enemy, and, when they do reveal themselves in strength, they will be so close to him that he will be unable to atomise them without destroying himself."
That then is the blueprint of warfare in the atomic age-the tactics and strategy of guerrillas.

REGULAR WARFARE

In regular warfare the tactical objective is to destroy the enemy in battle by concentrating superior numbers at a decisive time and place. The guerrilla strikes not one large blow but many little ones; he hits suddenly, gnaws at the enemy's strength, achieves surprise, disengages himself, withdraws, disperses and hits again.
A regular army unit depends on all kinds of tactical support: air, ground, communication, supplies, armour, artillery, reserves, units to left, right and rear. And so on. There are all kinds of weapons available. Plans are worked out by General Staffs, transmitted through a chain of command down the line. Attacks will go in under artillery, air and even sea barrages. Armour will create the breakthrough.
More often than not the line soldiers are unaware of what is happening or is supposed to happen. They rely on N.C.O.s and officers in all eventualities. They are trained to fight as cogs in an intricate and vast machine embracing perhaps millions like themselves.

THE GUERRILLA

The situation of a guerrilla is quite different.
Outside of the support he gets from the people among whom he operates-and this support must never be underestimated for it is vital to his eventual success-he fights alone. He is part of an independent formation that is in effect an army by itself. He must be self-contained.
If necessary he must act alone and fight alone with the weapons at his disposal—and these very often will not be of the best. He must find his own supplies. His endurance has to be great: and for this he needs a fit body and an alert mind. Above all he must know what he is fighting for—and why.
The guerrilla must move fast and hit hard. He must be adaptable. He must change his methods constantly.
His training must be such that during withdrawal his formation can break up and reform later. It is not his job to hold a line or take a city or maintain a strategically vital area.

But what he must do is this:

He must exhaust the enemy by constant harassment.

He must attack constantly and from all directions.

He must stage successful retreats, return to the attack, 
avoid encounters with the enemy that are not of his own making.

Tactics have to be changed constantly. Formations have to be independent of terrain and
lines of communications. This is what is meant by being self-contained.
The guerrilla never affords the enemy a target. He is bold in the attack and his great
advantage is mobility.
The plan of action must be simple, understood by all, and-if possible—well rehearsed.
The guerrilla's great weapon is surprise. To achieve this surprise, intelligence must be first-class. The guerrilla must know everything about the enemy and his battle-order, his strength and his weakness-even his plans for anti-guerrilla activities.
Good intelligence breeds good morale. And for the guerrilla morale is everything. It is this morale that gives the guerrilla his determination and his daring.
Once the fight is joined, it must be carried out relentlessly and to the bitter end. The road may be long, the sacrifices great, but if the guerrilla has this endurance and the will to win, he cannot be defeated.
To strive constantly towards these goals day by day, mounting small successes on bigger victories, building up the morale of the people, these are the aims of the volunteer guerrilla. They ensure final victory.
