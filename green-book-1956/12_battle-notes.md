Chapter 12 - Battle notes

The first essential is to kill the enemy without being killed yourself. The second is take advantage of all cover. Equipment must be camouflaged. This goes for face and hands too.
At night silence in movement is vital.
When sniping in open country never operate from same spot twice.
Continually being on the move is important for guerrillas. The enemy is thrown off by
this and overestimates numbers and power. This makes him sometimes alter his plans.

RAIDS

The plan should be simple and the attack timed. Rehearse if possible. Special training may be required depending on the job at hand. Intelligence must be excellent for this planning depends.

AMBUSH

Preparations must be well camouflaged and groups should move to assembly point in small formations. No contact should be made with local population. All fighters must be accurately briefed on plan, withdrawal and later assembly point.

Can be turned into battle drill in this fashion:

1. The fire base-main concentration of fire and opens up on enemy first.

2. The assault party—moves in for the kill if the situation requires and if not covers withdrawal of fire base.

3. Cut off—seals enemy retreat and covers assault. Groups will not be of equal size. The fire base will have heavier concentration of fire.

Site—very important. Must have cover and sheltered line of withdrawal. Fire base must be able to cover battle area and allow no cover to enemy who will try to encircle attackers.
Road may be mined to hit first enemy truck, and last truck may also be trapped by similar
mine to rear-blown not by contact but by electrical connection. Charges can be buried at a depth of nine inches or a foot. Four pounds per foot in length. These are enough to smash a lorry.
Signals must be clear and understood and ambushers must be in contact. Get-away must be swift. Look-outs are needed before enemy approaches. Aiming marks are valuable in killing area and can be prepared beforehand.

STRONGPOINT

Any enemy post is a strongpoint. Use fire base and assault section. Isolate post, use surprise to get to objective, lay charge to gain entry. First section moves in and clears ground floor. Section section clears, top, blow up, withdraw to prepared assembly point.
Rehearse if possible and each man should know his job.

FORCED MARCH

Move at night, change direction frequently, avoid inhabited localities and towns, go over heavily guarded territory in twos and threes, stay clear of roads. Check an assembly point and stopping points along the way. Guard front and flanks.

PATROLS

Mission must be precise. Men must know what their job is. A get-away man should be provided.
Select routes forward, stopping places, assembly, point, withdrawal. Study terrain, weather conditions, enemy dispositions. Use scouts.

MOVEMENTS

Use of formations-for open country use diamond. Use Indian file for close country. Be in position for all-round observation, each member has special area to observe.

SEARCH BUILDINGS

Cover front and rear. The two men advance cautiously and enter by blind side. Have signals.
Crossing roads—At bend. All together or in groups.

CONDUCT OF AN ATTACK

1. Select Forming Up Point (FUP).

2. Issue orders and if need be make last minute reconnaissance.

3. Stay under cover near objective until preparation is complete. This should be as brief as possible—matter of minutes or column will lose element of surprise.

4. Basis of attack is by fire and movement. First base covers movement of assaulting groups. Hold fire until last minute or until prearranged signal.

5. The assault is put in with aggressiveness and efficiency, each man knowing his job and doing it. Mission is then completed.

6. Withdrawal is also by fire and movement.

7. Break contact with enemy and reassemble at assembly point which is prearranged. Alternative assembly point is also necessary.

8. Get back to bases.

Orders—Should be brief and cover following points.

1. Information on the enemy.

2. Mission—what we have to do.

3. Method—how we will carry out mission.
This covers:
(a) The plan
(b) The route forward
(c) Formations
(d) What each section will do at objective. What each man will do. (This latter in section leader's orders.)
(e) Withdrawal
(f) Assembly point
(g) Alternative assembly point
(h) How to get back to bases.

4. Administration—includes (a) weapons distribution; (b) equipment; (c) where extra ammo is; (d) first aid and wounded.

5. Communication—signals used for attack, withdrawal, and others.

Watches should be synchronized and check back on orders and ask for questions.
In attacking enemy strongpoints maximum use should be made of explosives and the attack should be made silently at night. When covering fire opens up it should be intensive and be directed at enemy loop-holes and if possible be on (for LMGs) prepared fixed lines (use of two sticks to left and right).
The assaulting groups should be at as wide an angle as possible from fire group (90 degrees is ideal but may not always be possible). When entrance has been made the assault force should move in rapidly according to prepared drill, cover one another's inside movements, clear ground floor rooms by grenades and sub MG fire.
Second assault group should come, if possible, from top down. Have signals prepared. First group could then get back out and cover enemy driven downward.
Demolition group then destroys enemy base.

ESTIMATE OF SITUATION

For the guerrilla commander it is all important that he should have a correct estimate of the situation in all operations. In this way he discovers weaknesses in his plan, what extra information he requires, what special type of equipment he may have to use in a particular attack.
The estimate is an analysis of a set of circumstances to determine the best course of action to pursue. Its form is:

1. The mission—what is the task before him.

2. Situation and courses of action— (a) Enemy dispositions, activities, strength, reinforcements, time and weather, his own equipment, supply and transportation. Local politics of population, (b) Enemy capabilities—What the enemy is capable of doing to stop the job being carried out. What he is likely to door the courses of action open to him. (c) Our own courses of action-the various methods by which the mission may be carried out.

3. Analysis of opposing courses of action—Determine the effect of each enemy capability on our own courses of action.

4. Compare our various courses of action—Weigh the advantages and disadvantages. Decide which course of action promises to be the most successful in accomplishing the mission.

5. Decision—Translate the course of action selected into a concise statement of what you will do—also when, where, how you will do it.

INTELLIGENCE

Top intelligence work is necessary for guerrilla operations. Intelligence is the collection, analysis, distribution of enemy information. It may be collected many ways. It must be evaluated and analysed—check one against the other. Then it must be passed along to higher and lower command.
Information gathering is a continuous operation. It will be done by reconnaissance, by patrols, by establishing observation posts and listening posts which note the enemy's movements and routine, from the local population, by agents and so on.
The intelligence officer or commander should have an intelligence plan. This consists of (1) Essential elements of information—or what particular information is required about the enemy. (2) The analysis of EEI—the IO visualises what the enemy would do if he intended exercising any of the capabilities raised in EEI. For example, in his security measures of a barracks has he installed an alarm system, has he reinforced the defences, has he put more barbed wire on the walls, etc.? The IO looks for signs which will answer the specific questions raised in the Essential Elements of Information. There are indications that the enemy intends to do this or that. (3) IO lists reconnaissance and other intelligence methods to develop indications in column two. Is the enemy preparing for an attack on guerrillas? What are the indications that he is? Check these by specific missions. (4) Agencies to be employed in seeking information-patrols, OPs, listening posts, local inhabitants, agents and so on. (5) Hour and destination at which information is to be reported.

INTELLIGENCE PLAN

The IO works according to an intelligence plan. This is for his own guidance. But if specific information is required on an enemy target then he will make an intelligence summary on that target. That is he gives a full intelligence estimate (see estimate of the situation) on enemy-strength, disposition, defences, reinforcements, weather, terrain, local politics and so on. Here he will list everything pertaining to that enemy target.
The IO must know everything about the enemy. If he doesn't he must take steps to get his information. Then he must pass it along without delay.
There is only one sure way of getting information on the enemy: Go out and look for it.
A complete intelligence network should be built up in the enemy occupied area. Agents should be located in important localities and specialists should be sent after key information.
As many forces as possible should be used in intelligence work and the collection should be so organised that the agents are not put in jeopardy. Couriers would collect and agents would be walled off from contact with any other guerrillas.
Such a chain of information, difficult to build up, would keep the guerrillas informed of everything happening in enemy-controlled territory.
Counter-intelligence is also an important activity of guerrilla IOs. It means guarding our own security, denying information to the enemy and tracking down enemy agents.
